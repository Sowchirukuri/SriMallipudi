        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I'm Sri Lakshmi Sowmya Mallipudi, a professional with a diverse journey that has shaped my career and personal growth.</p>
        <p> My educational background includes a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering, and I started my career as a Software Quality Assurance Engineer at Broadcom in Hyderabad, India, where I spent 3.5 years dedicated to ensuring the highest standards of software quality.</p>
        <p> Life took an exciting turn as I embarked on a new chapter, marked by getting married in December 2021 and relocating to the United States.It took me more than 6 months to obtain an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). </p>
        <p> This phase allowed me to explore various opportunities in a foreign land.</p>
        <p> It was during this period that I embraced a role as a Starbucks Barista, where I refined my interpersonal skills and truly enjoyed serving people with a smile.</p>
        <p> However, my passion for technology and a desire to expand my horizons led me to pursue a significant career shift. I was thrilled to secure admission to the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at the University of Minnesota. 
        <p> This experience has been transformative, empowering me with the skills and knowledge needed for a career in web development.</p>
        <p> I'm a lifelong learner, driven by curiosity and a willingness to adapt. I look forward to leveraging my unique blend of technical expertise, adaptability, and dedication to make meaningful contributions to the dynamic world of web development.</p>
        <p> I'm excited about the future and the opportunities that await as I continue to grow personally and professionally.</p>
